# 🌍 Commudle

🔗 **[https://www.commudle.com/](https://www.commudle.com/)**

**Commudle** is an open platform designed to help **tech communities thrive** — from organizing events to nurturing long‑term engagement. Built from real-world experience, Commudle focuses on **how communities actually work**, not just how events are listed.

It is crafted **by community organizers, for community organizers**, with workflows shaped by feedback, scale, and on-ground realities.

---

## ✨ Why Commudle Exists

Running a tech community is rewarding — but it’s also hard.

Over the last **6 months**, Commudle has been used to:

* 🎤 Organize **5+ large-scale tech events**
* 👥 Manage **2200+ registrations** for a single event
* 🧑‍💻 Host **600+ attendees**
* 🧭 Run **6 parallel tracks**
* 🎙 Coordinate **30+ speakers**
* 🌐 Build a community of **5000+ registered members**

These aren’t projections — they’re real numbers from real events.

The name **Commudle** has a story (we’ll reveal it soon 😉), but the mission is clear:

> **Empower community organizers with structure, scale, and simplicity — without losing the human touch.**

Events hosted on Commudle are **free for participants**, because community is about access and learning. Our goal is to make organizing those events **smooth, scalable, and sustainable**.
